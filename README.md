# Django Templates, Template Tags, and Form Validation Project

This project was created as part of a learning exercise to practice using Django templates, template tags, and form validation. The objective was to create a functional web page that displays dynamic content and handles form data using Django's templating and form system.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to apply knowledge of Django templates and form handling to create a web page with dynamic content and interactive user input. The project involved using template tags, loops, conditionals, template filters, and form validation to enhance the presentation and functionality of the page.

### What I Learned

- **Django Templates**: Learned how to design and structure templates using Django's syntax to display dynamic data.
- **Template Tags**: Implemented template tags such as loops and conditionals to control the flow of content on the page.
- **Template Filters**: Used template filters to format and manipulate data, including date formatting for improved readability.
- **Dynamic Content**: Developed skills in passing data from views to templates to render user-specific information.
- **Form Handling in Django**: Learned how to create and validate forms to collect user input using Django's built-in form capabilities.
- **Form Validation**: Implemented basic form validation to ensure that required fields are filled out correctly and that email addresses have a valid format.
- **Error and Success Messages**: Enhanced the user experience by displaying error messages for invalid submissions and success messages upon successful form submission.

## Project Details

- **Page Type**: Includes a user profile page that displays user details and a list of posts, as well as a contact page with a form to collect user input.
- **Dynamic Elements**: Uses template tags to loop through posts, display them conditionally, and handle form submissions.
- **Data Formatting**: Applied date formatting filters to display dates in a user-friendly format.
- **Form Fields**: Created a contact form with fields for the user's name and email, with built-in validation.
